Data Science plays a role so important in a majority of online services and helps not only bring more customers but keeps the existing ones happy. The reason why is because, with Data Science, you get a more realistic picture of your consumers’ taste in the form of graphs and charts that take not just one metric but several as input. This crucial piece of information helps you in molding your products and services in a way that looks one-of-a-kind to your customers, attracting them to your platform.

With a company like Netflix that is brimming with data, it’s always a wise decision to put that pile of data to good use. By incorporating concepts like data analysis, machine learning, statistics and deep learning, Data Science can help not just Netflix but any business to grow exponentially regardless of sector.

In this code I will implement how we used deep learning models to create a clustering model for the online netflix movies data
I have used different models including BIRCH ,Optics,DBSCAN,KMEANS ..... to get the best fit for the data and get the refined clusters
